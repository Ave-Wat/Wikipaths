# Wikipaths
This is a project from my CS201 Data Structures class. The project uses several algorithms to find the shortest path through wikipedia pages. (For example, how many clicks does it take to get from the Duran Duran wikipedia page to the Canada Goose wikipedia page?). Run the PathFinder file.
